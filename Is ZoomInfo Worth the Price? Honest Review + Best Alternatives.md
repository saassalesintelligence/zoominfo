## Evaluation Criteria
When comparing ZoomInfo with its competitors, I used six criteria that consistently matter to teams making real buying decisions:

1. **Pricing Transparency** – Is pricing public and flexible, or hidden behind sales calls?  
2. **Data Accuracy** – Bounce rates, phone validity, and update frequency.  
3. **Coverage** – Number of contacts, global vs. US bias, industry focus.  
4. **Ease of Use** – Can a small team onboard quickly, or does it require training?  
5. **Compliance** – GDPR/CCPA readiness and ethical sourcing.  
6. **Support & Integrations** – Responsiveness and CRM/marketing stack fit.
